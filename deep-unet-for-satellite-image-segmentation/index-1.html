<h2 id="about-this-project">About this project</h2>
<p>This is a Keras based implementation of a deep UNet that performs satellite image segmentation.</p>
<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<ul>
<li>The dataset consists of 8-band commercial grade satellite imagery taken from SpaceNet dataset.</li>
<li>Train collection contains few tiff files for each of the 24 locations.</li>
<li>Every location has an 8-channel image containing spectral information of several wavelength channels (red, red edge, coastal, blue, green, yellow, near-IR1 and near-IR2). These files are located in data/mband/ directory.</li>
<li>Also available are correctly segmented images of each training location, called mask. These files contain information about 5 different classes: buildings, roads, trees, crops and water (note that original Kaggle contest had 10 classes).</li>
<li>Resolution for satellite images s 16-bit. However, mask-files are 8-bit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deep Unet architecture is employed to perform segmentation.</li>
<li>Image augmentation is used for input images to significantly increases train data.</li>
<li>Image augmentation is also done while testing, mean results are exported to result.tif image.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Training for this model was done on a Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB GPU.</p>
